# auntiesrecipes
A searchable archive of BBC Food Recipes.

Homepage: https://www.auntiesrecipes.co.uk

Features I would like help with:

* A 'no results' message.
* Paginated / infinite-scrollable results
* Download all the images and add them to the repo so I don't have to hotlink them
* Better isVegetarian detection in the scraper
* Search option based on prep/cooking/total time
